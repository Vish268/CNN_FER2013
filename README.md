# CNN model REPOSITORY

## Problem Statement
The problem in question is to classify images from the FER 2013 Databases into its constituent classes (Emotions).
These being : ['anger','fear','disgust','happy','neutral','sad','surprise']

## Approach
A CNN (convolutional neural network) model is being used in this project since for the image classification it, on average has a higher accuaracy.
The various layers of the cnn model were modified randomly for optimization. 

## Results
The average accuracy was 52 % in the testing dataset. Though this seems low, during the actual trial with random pictures from the internet ,it yielded a much better result.

## Challenges
During the intial stages of testing with the test data set, the accuracy was around 20 %.This might have been because of the lack of resolution in the pictures (48x48)


## NOTE
Currently only jpg/jpeg images are supported.
